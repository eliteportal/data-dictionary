## Welcome to ELITE Metadata Dictionary

ELITE Metadata Dictionary empowers you to explore ELITE metadata terms by key, value, or descriptions. You can use the main search bar at the top of the page or the main navigation on the left side of the page to query the entire dictionary, the small search bar on the table to query by keywords, and the pagination at the bottom to flip through the table.

To see a full list of terms found in the data model see the [Full Table](docs/FullTable.html) page.

## Note on Filling in Templates for DCA

- `Other[value]` are used when "Other" is selected in column because the valid value is not apart of the list. This will prompt you to enter in your own value in a separate column under `Other[value]`. For example if "Other" is selected for the column`cellType`then you can enter in your value under `OtherCellType`. This helps us capture any information outside of the current data model.

## Issues and Request new term or value

Please create a ticket using the service desk linked above.
