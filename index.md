## Welcome to ELITE Metadata Dictionary

ELITE Metadata Dictionary empowers you to explore ELITE metadata terms by key, value, or descriptions. You can use the main search bar at the top of the page or the main navigation on the left side of the page to query the entire dictionary, the small search bar on the table to query by keywords, and the pagination at the bottom to flip through the table.
